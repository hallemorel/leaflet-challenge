Leaflet: Visualizing Data:


Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in earthquake data, so for this project I created a visualization that collected the massive amount of data from all over the world and presented it to visually see how earthquakes impact the world. 

Using Leaflet to create a map using the longitude and altitude data in the GeoJSON file and with HTML, Javascript and CSS. 
Features of the map included:

-  Data markers which reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.


-  I included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.


-  Finally I created a legend that will provide context for the map data.
